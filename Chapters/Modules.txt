#Modules
Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module
The moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__
from fibo import * - This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (_).
